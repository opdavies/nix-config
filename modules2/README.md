I'm refactoring my configuration to follow [the dendritic pattern](https://github.com/mightyiam/dendritic), inspired by <https://github.com/mightyiam/infra>.

Rather than a large rewrite, I am incrementally refactoring my configuration in-place.

This directory contains the modules that have been refactored, and will eventually replace the existing `modules` directory.
